# Keep Teams Active
Currently a work in progress. Need to do more testing on macOS.
Works by pressing the F13 key every 3 minutes (yes that's a real key.) Expect this to also keep your computer constanly on.
If you are prompted for permissions for this to you, you need to grant them (notably the accessibility settings in macOS.)
